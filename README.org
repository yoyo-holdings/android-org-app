#+TITLE: Android Org App
#+AUTHOR: Zak B. Elep <zak.elep@yoyo-holdings.com>

Android Org App is [[https://github.com/yoyo-holdings][YOYO]]'s technical test.  This is a standard Android
application that provides a simple organizer for the user to store notes
and TODOs.

* Instructions

  1. Fork this repository on your own personal GitHub account.
  2. Download your fork, build this app, and begin making changes.
  3. When finished, create a Pull Request to merge into YOYO's version,
     then send an email to [[https://github.com/zakame][@zakame]] to let him know you're ready for
     review.
  4. We will close the pull request.

  You may also submit your commits using =git format-patch=, should you
  prefer it over GitHub PRs.

* Specifications

  1. The app consists of two major activities:
     - a note-taking activity that accepts a =title= and =entry= for one
       or more notes
     - a TODO tracking activity that accepts an =entry=, with a
       =checkbox= to show whether this entry has been done or not done
  2. The app should have a user interface that allows for easy access
     between the note-taking and TODO tracking activities as well as to
     see their details at a glance.
  3. The note-taking activity should provide a view for its notes in a
     reverse-chronological order, with options for updating and deleting
     old notes.
  4. The TODO-tracking activity should provide a view for its entries
     with options for updating and deleting old TODOs.
  5. The app should make it easy to switch between the note-taking and
     TODO-tracking activities.
  6. The app should make it easy to switch a note to a TODO entry, and
     vice versa.
  7. The release APK of the app should take up no more than 3MB of disk
     space.
  8. The release APK should target Android devices running version 4.4
     (KitKat) and up.
